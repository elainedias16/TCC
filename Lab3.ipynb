            "You: Image you're Jane Austen and write a pice of summary of your new book\n",
            "Gemini: My latest offering, \"The Unruly Heart\", follows the tangled affairs of the Dashwood sisters, Henrietta and Marianne. Henrietta, blessed with a charming wit and a head for business, finds herself unexpectedly drawn to the enigmatic Mr. Thornton, a man of wealth and mystery. Meanwhile, Marianne, her sister, a creature of passionate temperament, finds herself captivated by the dashing but impetuous Lord Devereaux. \n",
            "\n",
            "Their paths, however, are not so easily entwined.  Henrietta's pragmatism clashes with Mr. Thornton's guarded nature, while Marianne's fierce independence clashes with Lord Devereaux's desire for control.  As their romances blossom, so too do the secrets that threaten to unravel their carefully constructed worlds.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Expect, my dear reader, a whirlwind of witty dialogue, romantic entanglements, and a healthy dose of societal satire, all set against the backdrop of the English countryside.  Will Henrietta and Marianne find their true happiness?  Will their hearts overcome the obstacles that stand in their way?  Only time, and the careful reading of \"The Unruly Heart\", will tell. \n",

            "\n",
            "Lizzie, with her sharp wit and independent spirit, would likely be drawn to Henrietta's practicality and shrewdness.  She might find Henrietta's cautious approach to love both admirable and amusing, perhaps offering her friend a bit of playful advice on how to navigate the complexities of Mr. Thornton's guarded heart. \n",
            "\n",
            "Marianne's passionate nature would undoubtedly spark Lizzie's interest, but she might also find her friend's impulsive nature a tad reckless.  Lizzie would likely offer a gentle but firm hand to guide Marianne away from the pitfalls of Lord Devereaux's charms, reminding her that true love is not merely a whirlwind of emotions, but a solid foundation of shared respect and understanding. \n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, Lizzie's presence would inject a healthy dose of her own brand of humor and keen observation into the narrative.  She would be a delightful observer of the social machinations and romantic entanglements, offering pithy commentary on the characters' follies and foibles.  Her sharp wit would undoubtedly expose the hypocrisy of the social circles surrounding Henrietta and Marianne, providing both amusement and a subtle critique of the societal norms of the time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yes, Elizabeth Bennet in \"The Unruly Heart\" would be a delightful addition, bringing her own unique blend of intelligence, wit, and independent spirit to the unfolding dramas of the Dashwood sisters.  She would be a loyal friend, a keen observer, and a source of both amusement and insight, making the tale even more captivating. \n",

Mr Loughton, who was subjected to sanctions by China in 2021, described the experience as “very lonely and frightening”. China's foreign office said the accusations were baseless.

            "1. **Abstract Class:**\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Concrete Classes:**\n",
            "   - `Circle` and `Rectangle` are concrete classes inheriting from `Shape`. They provide their own implementations of the `draw()` method.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Factory Class:**\n",
            "   - The `ShapeFactory` class has a static method `get_shape()`. This method takes the shape type as input and returns the corresponding shape object.\n",
            "   - It uses conditional logic to decide which concrete shape class to instantiate and return.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Usage:**\n",
            "   - We specify the desired `shape_type` (e.g., \"circle\").\n",
            "   - The `ShapeFactory.get_shape()` method creates the appropriate shape object.\n",
            "   - We then call the `draw()` method on the returned object to perform the specific drawing action.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Points of the Factory Method Pattern:**\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Encapsulation:** The client code (where we use the factory) doesn't need to know the concrete implementations of the shapes. It just interacts with the `ShapeFactory`.\n",
            "- **Flexibility:** We can easily add new shape types by creating new concrete classes and updating the factory's `get_shape()` method.\n",
            "- **Code Readability:** The code is more readable and maintainable as it separates the shape creation logic from the client code.\n",
            "\n",
            "This example showcases the basic structure of the Factory Method pattern. You can adapt it to your specific needs by defining different shape classes and implementing the appropriate logic in the `get_shape()` method.\n",

            "   - `display()`: Prints the vehicle details.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Creating Prototypes:**\n",
            "   - `car` and `truck` are instances of `Vehicle` representing prototypes of different vehicle types.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Cloning Vehicles:**\n",
            "   - `car_clone` and `truck_clone` are created by calling the `clone()` method on the prototypes. This effectively creates copies of the original vehicles.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Displaying Vehicles:**\n",
            "   - The `display()` method is used to print the details of both the original and cloned vehicles.\n",

            "**Key Points:**\n",
            "\n",
            "- The `clone()` method implements the core of the Prototype pattern, allowing you to create copies of existing objects without needing to re-instantiate them with the same parameters.\n",
            "- This is useful when you have multiple instances of the same type of object with varying properties and want to easily create copies of those objects without repeating the initialization process.\n",
            "- You can extend this example by adding more vehicle types or by implementing methods for modifying the cloned vehicles' attributes.\n",
            "\n",
