        "Os Large Language Models (LLMs) têm apresentado desempenhos notáveis em diversas tarefas, como resumo de textos, criação de conteúdo, correção gramatical, auxílio na criação de códigos e resposta a perguntas, entre outras tarefas. Devido a esses avanços, muitas empresas estão interessadas em utilizar LLMs para aumentar a eficiência operacional. No entanto, a criação e o treinamento de um modelo LLM exigem alta capacidade técnica, computacional e tempo. Por isso, muitas empresas optam por utilizar LLMs comerciais. Para uso geral, essas ferramentas podem ser acessadas diretamente através de navegadores. No entanto, para integrar LLMs comerciais com outras ferramentas e sistemas, é necessário a utilização de APIs, que permitem a conexão e a comunicação entre diferentes plataformas. Dessa forma, à medida que o uso de LLM comerciais no mercado de trabalho continua a crescer, aprender a utilizá-las por meio de APIs torna-se essencial."

The estate, Bleakworth Manor, is more than just a grand house - it houses a peculiar secret that has the potential to disrupt society's delicate balance.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Enter Mr. Charles Blackwood, a handsome and enigmatic gentleman** whose pursuit of Amelia's hand is more than just a matter of social standing.  His interest in Bleakworth Manor, and its hidden secret, is clear, but his motives remain shrouded in mystery.  \n",
            "\n",
            "**As Amelia navigates the complexities of her newfound wealth and position,** she finds herself caught between the expectations of society and her own desire for independence.  The arrival of her spirited cousin, Miss Eliza Thornton, throws Amelia's world into further disarray, as Eliza's wit and charm challenge Amelia's carefully constructed world.  \n",
            "\n",

            "* **Love and Marriage:**  A complex portrayal of romantic relationships, exploring the intricacies of attraction, desire, and societal pressures.\n",

It is a testament to Jane Austen's enduring mastery of storytelling, and a timely reminder of the enduring power of human relationships in a world of social change and complex societal structures.\n",

Her presence would immediately shake things up, injecting a dose of humor and pragmatism into the often-serious world of Amelia and Mr. Blackwood.\n",
            "* **A Sharp Observer:** Lizzie, with her keen eye for character, would quickly perceive the hidden tensions and secrets surrounding Bleakworth Manor. She'd notice Mr. Blackwood's hidden agenda and Amelia's inner struggles, offering insightful commentary and even a bit of playful teasing.\n",
            "* **A Confidante:** Lizzie would be a close confidante to Amelia, offering  support and guidance as Amelia navigates the complexities of her newfound wealth and position. Lizzie would help Amelia see through the facade of society and challenge her own assumptions about love and marriage. \n",
            "* **A Matchmaker, Perhaps?** Lizzie, ever the romantic, might even play a role in bringing Amelia and Mr. Blackwood closer, though she would likely do so with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, ensuring that the path to love is anything but smooth.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lizzie's presence would add a layer of playful tension and societal critique to the story, highlighting the complexities of female agency and the absurdity of certain social conventions.  Her sharp wit and independent spirit would be a welcome addition to the world of Bleakworth Manor, reminding us that even in a world of secrets and societal pressures, there is always room for a touch of Lizzy Bennet's delightful irreverence. \n",

            "1. **Abstract Base Class (Shape):**\n",
            "   - Defines the `draw()` method, which is common to all shapes but not implemented.\n",
            "   - This ensures that any concrete shape class must provide its own implementation for drawing.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Concrete Classes (Circle, Square):**\n",
            "   - Inherit from the `Shape` class.\n",
            "   - Provide specific implementations for the `draw()` method, reflecting how each shape is drawn.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Factory Class (ShapeFactory):**\n",
            "   - The `get_shape()` method is the factory method.\n",
            "   - It takes a `shape_type` string as input.\n",
            "   - Based on the `shape_type`, it creates and returns the corresponding concrete shape object (Circle or Square).\n",
            "   - If an invalid `shape_type` is provided, it returns `None`.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Usage:**\n",
            "   - The code demonstrates how to use the factory method to create shape objects.\n",
            "   - By passing different `shape_type` values to `ShapeFactory.get_shape()`, you can get instances of different shapes.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Benefits of the Factory Method Pattern:**\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Decoupling:** The client code (where you call `get_shape()`) doesn't need to know how to create concrete shapes directly.\n",
            "- **Flexibility:** You can easily add new shape types without modifying existing code.\n",
            "- **Centralized creation:** All shape creation logic is contained within the factory class.\n",
            "- **Improved maintainability:** Changes to the shape creation process are isolated in the factory.\n",
            "\n",
            "This code provides a clear and simple implementation of the Factory Method pattern in Python. You can adapt it to create different kinds of objects based on varying criteria.\n",

            "\n",

            "   - They override the `clone()` method to ensure they create copies of their specific type.\n",
            "\n",

            "   - The code creates prototypes for a `Car` and `Motorcycle`.\n",
            "   - New vehicles are created by calling the `clone()` method on the prototypes, creating deep copies with the same attributes.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Other Join Types:**  SQL supports other join types, such as `CROSS JOIN` (which creates a cartesian product of the tables), which you can also replicate in R's `dplyr` package.\n",
            "* **Multiple Joins:**  You can combine multiple joins in a single SQL query (e.g., `INNER JOIN` followed by `LEFT JOIN`). `dplyr` supports this too, with `chainable` functions.\n",
